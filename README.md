# 🌱 FARMLYTICS – AI Crop Recommendation System

FARMLYTICS is an AI-powered agriculture advisory system designed to help farmers and agri-professionals make informed crop selection decisions based on soil and environmental parameters.  
This project is adapted and enhanced from an AI Crop Advisor base and redesigned with a modern, user-friendly frontend.
